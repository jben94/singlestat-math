# Single Stat Math Panel

This panel is a modification of the native single stat panel to support math functions across series.
This the fork: https://github.com/black-mirror-1/singlestat-math

### Usage

### InfluxDB

To use the math feature, give the series an alias by name and use that name inside the math field as variables.

In the math field you can use the alias names to perform math across series.
